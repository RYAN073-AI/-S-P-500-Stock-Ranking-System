# -S-P-500-Stock-Ranking-System
This project builds an ML pipeline that ranks S&amp;P 500 stocks as Buy, Hold, or Sell using Yahoo Finance data. Stocks are scored on valuation, profitability, growth, and financial health metrics. Multiple ML models train on these scores to predict rankings. The workflow produces a CSV with predictions and includes a backtest against the S&amp;P 500.
